# Jekyll Site Template Repository

This is a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), used for the creation of new Git Repositories with a Jekyll web site ready enabled.

The created repo will contain a `/docs` folder with which Jekyll will work to generate the web site. Initially the web site will be styled using the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

You can jump right in and start here: https://github.com/bill-richardsjekyll-site-template-repository/generate

The name of your repository will be the subpath of your published website. This will generally be `https://<your-github-account_name>.gihub.io/<your-repository-name>`

Add a one-line description of your new repository, then click "Create repository from template".

Once created, your new repository will execute a GitHub Actions workflow that uses cookiecutter to rewrite the repository to the desired state. This make take 30 seconds or so.
