# [_Jekyll Site Template_](https://github.com/bill-richards/jekyll-site-template)

## If this is your new repo

Your repo is currently being setup. While that's happening you should head along to the settings page
where you should enable Github Pages. Be sure to set the branch to `develop` and the folder to `/docs` 
then click save. when you've finished there come back here, and if the configuration of the repository
has completed, this [README.md](./) document will have changed. 

If you come back here and can still read this document, click [HERE](./) to see about bringing a little change 
around here. 

## If this is not your new repo

This is a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), used for the creation of new Git Repositories with a Jekyll web site ready enabled.

The created repo will contain a `/docs` folder with which Jekyll will work to generate the web site. Initially the web site will be styled using the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

Why don't you jump right in and 
- start [here](https://github.com/bill-richards/jekyll-site-template/generate)
- then 
  - add a description for your new repository, 
  - and click "Create repository from template".

The name of your repository will be the subpath of your published website. This will generally be `https://<your-github-account_name>.gihub.io/<your-repository-name>`

Once created, your new repository will execute a GitHub Actions workflow that uses the [_Jekyll site cookiecutter_](https://github.com/bill-richards/jekyll-site-cookiecutter) to reconfigure the repository. This process make take 30 seconds or so, depending upon the availability of runners to pick up the workflow.
